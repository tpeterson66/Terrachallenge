# Terrachallange

This is a challnage to test your knowledge of Terraform and supporting Terraform in various environments. There are a series of checkpoints that should be used as save points within the challange. Each checkpoint builds on the previous checkpoint, so make sure you complete each checkpoint in order.

## Getting Started

Get started by creating a repo in your personal github account. Make sure the project is public - make sure you do not store credentials in the repo ;)

Consider using a readme.md file in your repo for your notes, works in progres, etc. to track your own progress on the project.

I suggest using VSCode as your editor. There is no requirement to use this for Terraform or Azure, however, its free and has a lot fo support around opensource projects.

You will need to install Terraform locally.

You will need Git locally as well:
https://git-scm.com/download/win
Learn the basics of using git. commits, branches, merge requests, merge conflicts, rebase, switching between branches, etc.

Get started by understanding what IaC is, not just Terraform. Terraform is a IaC tool, its not IaC...

Let me know if you find something else that helps you pick up on the concepts

Get to know Terraform!
Here is the documentation for Terraform:
https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/index.html
Focus on the CLI features (init, plan, apply, destroy, validate, fmt, etc.)

## Completing the Challange

In order to complete this challange, make sure you create a public repo and create a branch for each checkpoint. When you complete the checkpoint and everything works, complete a merge request to move your checkpoint to the main branch and then create a new branch for the next checkpoint.
